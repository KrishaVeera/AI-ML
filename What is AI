# **What is AI?**

- AI refers to simulated intelligence by machines, resembling human intelligence.
- Examples: Chatbots with pre-programmed responses.

**AI vs. ML (Machine Learning):**

- **AI**: General term for machines that simulate intelligence.
- **ML**: Subfield of AI where machines learn from data and improve over time.
    - **Example**: A model that learns responses from chat logs.

### **Machine Learning Types**

**1. Supervised Learning:**

- **Definition**: Model learns from labeled data.
- **Example**: Classifying traffic light colors (Red, Yellow, Green) based on image data.

**2. Unsupervised Learning:**

- **Definition**: Model identifies patterns from unlabeled data.
- **Example**: Clustering words based on their semantic vectors.

**3. Reinforcement Learning:**

- **Definition**: Model learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties.
- **Example**: Learning to play a game by maximizing rewards through trial and error.

### **Deep Learning**

- **Definition**: A subset of machine learning using neural networks to model complex problems.
- **Application**: Can be applied to supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning tasks.

### **Machine Learning in Data Science:**

- ML can be used to analyze and predict trends from data.
- Not all data analysis involves ML; simple visualizations do not.
